# Finite State Automata

Python implementation of Finite State Automata, which are mostly used in formal linguistics or to represent regular expressions. For now, app has basic functionalities,
such as: DFA, NFA, e-NFA creation and conversion from one to another. Typical result is presented below:

More functionalities, such as plotting, conversion from RegEx to DFA and DFA minimalization are to be implemented. Most of the classes and methods are documented with
Google-Style docstrings for best user experience. Example automaton creation can be found in main.py file.
